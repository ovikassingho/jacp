#about me.

I am a father, husband and a passionate software developer having fun in coding, engineering and [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/30866998@N07/).  Although my current job is focused on Java business development I do enjoy discovering all kind of programming languages, frameworks and operating systemsâ€¦ and nearly everything what you can do with a computer. My current obsession is to discover the boundaries of software scalability and to provide a straightforward access for all who wants to create efficiently applications and a great user experience.
